= Introduction
In recent years, but for decades by now, the demand for a paradigm shift in transportation infrastructure and service has become louder and louder.
While calls for a shift away from car centric mobility are nothing new and were a well established part of German Academic discourse in the 1990s already @frank_hat_1993, it has become part of a widespread political discourse around the so called _Verkehrswende_ @holzapfel_urbanismus_2020.
With increased awareness and concrete experiences of climate change this discourse has reached states of heated debate.
Benefits of 


== Transit Equity and Equality
=== Motivation
- Traditional transport planning centering on men?
  - German Transport Planning post world war 2?
- Transit planning and identifying demand in public transit networks is a complicated process, that takes into account a plethora of data that's hard to access or acquire @pieper_kreislauf_2021.
=== Research Question
- How can an easy closenes centrality measure help asses transit service availability and equality
