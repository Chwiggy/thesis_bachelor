	abstract = {Although public transportation is considered effective at reducing the external cost of driving private vehicles, many urbanites do not use public transportation. This study develops measures employing accessibility, mobility, and seamless connectivity for an entire public transportation service chain as indicators for evaluating public transport services, prioritizes underperforming scenarios from the perspective of urban travelers, and derives various market segmentation strategies that consider different socio-demographic characteristics. A conceptual model is set up herein to assess these latent constructs that describe unobservable and immeasurable characteristics. As a Likert ordinal scale can generate misleading statistical inferences, the Rasch model is used to eliminate bias generated by an ordinal scale when measuring these three latent constructs separately. The Rasch model compares person parameters with item parameters, which are then subjected to logarithmic transformation along a logit scale so as to recognize specific difficulties of service scenarios that cannot be easily eliminated by certain urban travelers. The multidimensional Rasch model also measures the perceptions of urban travelers in terms of the interactions between accessibility, mobility, and seamless connectivity of this public transportation system. While comparing urban travelers of two large cities in Taiwan, Taipei and Kaohsiung, the empirical results demonstrate that perceived accessibility, mobility, and seamless connectivity differ based on travelers’ age, frequency of weekly sports activities, and environmental awareness. This paper also advances appropriate improvement strategies and provides policy suggestions for urban planners, public transportation service operation agencies, and policy makers when they seek to create user-friendly public transportation services. The proposed approach can be generalized in other cities by considering their local context uniqueness and further evaluating their public transport services.},

	abstract = {There is a consensus that the developing the urban rail transit system is the prime way for solving urban traffic problems. Urban rail network has been identified as a complex network. In this paper, three kinds of centrality characteristics of an urban rail network have been analyzed. The degree-based index describes the possible travel activities that travelers can get at a station. The betweenness-based index describes the ability to control the travel activities of a station. The closeness-based index describes the independence or efficiency of a station. Three indices reflect the importance of a station from different viewpoints. Shanghai urban rail network is taken as the object to be analyzed, which consists of 12 lines and 296 stations. The analysis results about the importance of stations and the importance of lines are compared with their operational conditions. It indicates that the closeness centrality is the index most relevant to the operational condition of the line. The centrality characteristics analysis is useful for the urban transit management and operation affairs and is the basic for the network's vulnerability analysis which is important for the safety of urban rail transit system.},

	abstract = {Centrality and intermediacy are identified in this article as spatial qualities that enhance the traffic levels of transportation hubs, and hence indicate which places are strategically located within transportation systems. The local, regional, national, continental or hemispheric centrality of a city has a fundamental impact on the city's own size and function and on its traffic-generating powers. Intermediacy, while it may reflect a natural geographical ‘in betweenness’, is a spatial quality that needs to be defined in the specific context of contemporary or prospective transportation systems and networks. Intermediate places can be given extra traffic if they are favoured by transport carriers as connecting hubs or relay points in the system. Passenger traffic data at US airports and container traffic at US and foreign seaports are used to illustrate these concepts of strategic commercial location. In many instances we are able to differentiate between true origin-destination and connecting traffic, giving a rough idea of the comparative contributions of the centrality and intermediacy factors to the traffic totals. It is no surprise that all large transportion hubs possess, at some scale and to some degree, both locational attributes — centrality and intermediacy.},

	abstract = {Whilst being hailed as the remedy to the world’s ills, cities will need to adapt in the 21st century. In particular, the role of public transport is likely to increase significantly, and new methods and technics to better plan transit systems are in dire need. This paper examines one fundamental aspect of transit: network centrality. By applying the notion of betweenness centrality to 28 worldwide metro systems, the main goal of this paper is to study the emergence of global trends in the evolution of centrality with network size and examine several individual systems in more detail. Betweenness was notably found to consistently become more evenly distributed with size (i.e. no “winner takes all”) unlike other complex network properties. Two distinct regimes were also observed that are representative of their structure. Moreover, the share of betweenness was found to decrease in a power law with size (with exponent 1 for the average node), but the share of most central nodes decreases much slower than least central nodes (0.87 vs. 2.48). Finally the betweenness of individual stations in several systems were examined, which can be useful to locate stations where passengers can be redistributed to relieve pressure from overcrowded stations. Overall, this study offers significant insights that can help planners in their task to design the systems of tomorrow, and similar undertakings can easily be imagined to other urban infrastructure systems (e.g., electricity grid, water/wastewater system, etc.) to develop more sustainable cities.},

Thereafter, we gathered the latitude and longitude coordinates of commercial complexes and depicted their spatial distribution. Then, we studied the spatial distribution pattern and coupling effect of the UPTN’s centrality and the commercial complexes using Kernel Density Estimation and spatial autocorrelation. Finally, a case study based on Xi'an City, China was conducted. The results show that the UPTN possesses multi-center characteristics of closeness, betweenness and straightness; the distribution of urban commercial complexes is mainly concentrated in the existing commercial circles of the city; there is a positive linear correlation between the UPTN’s centrality and the distribution of commercial complexes.

	abstract = {Centralisation of activities and developments around metro station areas is a key transit-oriented development (TOD) policy to encourage more public transport travel through providing maximum access to passengers, thereby enhancing economic efficiency, health, well-being and social inclusion. The node-place-design model is an analytical approach, which investigates the interaction between land use, transportation and the walking friendliness around station areas. Nevertheless, current research focuses on the role station areas plays at the local scale, and little consideration is given to the strategic network (system) level. In this research, we combine a strategic network indicator (criticality) with the node-place-design model to gain deeper insights into London metro station areas in terms of their transit-oriented-development at both local and system levels. Our research has three principal findings: first, most of station areas in Greater London show balanced situations between transport and land use development, except for some stations with a non-walking friendly environment such as Victoria station. Second, the two-tier approach finds that the system criticality of each station area can vary substantially even within the same cluster grouped by the original node-place-design model. Therefore, identifying station groups with relatively high network criticality and relatively low node-place-design score is of potential value. The promising transport connection and less-developed conditions of those station areas could help policymakers locate an intensification-diversification TOD group. Conversely, locations with high node-place-design values but low criticality could point to stations suitable for network expansion (new lines or interchanges). Third, the result reconfirms the value of introducing the third dimension – design – into the TOD evaluation of stations at the local scale. The relatively low correlation between node and design value is consistent with previous findings that a transport service-intensive and functionally diverse metro station area does not necessarily produce an accessible friendly walking environment. Overall, the paper provides a platform for further studies integrating strategic network and node-place-design attributes.},

Using a bipartite network approach, we develop several weighted centrality-based connectivities to quantify the degree of dependencies of urban bus transit on streets. Two megacities with different road patterns, i.e., Beijing and Shanghai in China are taken as examples to depict comparatively spatial inequalities of the centrality-based dependencies at both local and global scales. Then, a series of spatial cross-section regression models are introduced to explore the colocation relationships between the dependencies of bus transit and urban socioeconomic intensities. The methodology of kernel density estimation (KDE) is used to convert all data with different scales into the same unit of measurement. Results indicate that there are significant statistical and spatial inequalities of the centrality-based dependencies of bus transit on urban streets. These inequalities with evident hierarchies, variances and clusters were validated by statistical analysis including power-law function, rank-size distribution, multiple variance indices, together with Global Moran's I. Besides, a majority of bus transit rely heavily on minor streets concentrating on circumferential expressways in central urban areas and radial highways oriented to outer suburbs under industrial or residential suburbanization. The unequal distribution is found to be strongly related to population, nighttime light intensity, transport-related services, and commercial and leisure services by the spatial regression models. A good spatial matching between bus routes' dependencies and socioeconomic activities intensities is found both in these two megacities.},

Using housing price data from {\textgreater}400 neighborhoods across the city of Kolkata, India, our research shows that a neighborhood's centrality within the intra-urban road transportation network is positively associated with the average price per sq. ft. of ownership units in multistory apartment buildings in the neighborhood. We test the relationships of three alternative centrality indices – closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector – capturing different dimensions of network-wide connectedness with housing price, independently and in combination. We employ two alternative network weights to derive centrality considering peak-period and off-peak travel conditions and road transportation network performance. We address the spatial autocorrelation issue to derive robust evidence on the centrality-price relationship. Our results suggest that centrality is an intrinsic location advantage that positively influences urban housing price. Different centrality indices have different effects on price but they collectively reinforce each other. The estimated magnitudes of association between centrality indices and housing price are significant for policy and practice. In addition to contributing to scholarship in the domain of transportation planning, our research offers specific takeaways for metropolitan planning agencies and real-estate developers, especially in resource constrained geographic contexts.},

In this paper, we proposed an improved centrality measure, the Adaptive PageRank Algorithm Modified by the Gravity Model (APAMGM), to identify critical nodes in MNs. We modified the idea that the transition probability of a node is only related to its outgoing connections (or degree in an undirected network) in the adapted PageRank algorithm. In APAMGM, the transition probability is positively correlated with the quality of nodes and inversely correlated with the interaction impedance between nodes. We conducted a case study using a multiplex urban transportation network in Shenzhen, China, which consists of a bus, metro, taxi, and shared bike network. The results show that APAGMG can identify critical nodes with good interpretability and it displays potential for application in networks where spatial interactions exist between nodes. The interdependencies in the network were explored and discussed with the characterization of nodes. This study might provide insights into applying complex network theory and centrality measures to some MNs, especially urban transportation networks.},

This paper presents a modeling framework that utilizes multi-source travel data to explore public transport ridership across multiple modes, including bus, transit (bus and metro), taxi, and shared bike ridership. A study conducted in Shenzhen, China found that common factors influence ridership across multiple transportation modes, and their effects vary by public transport mode. The joint contribution of variables related to the transportation network or points of interest to public transport ridership is substantial, but the effect of trans­ portation network variables on different types of ridership varies significantly. Factors such as population density, distance to metro station, intersection density, shopping, and entertainment have similar associations with different types of ridership. The analysis of the active ranges and thresholds of built environment factors provides specific references for enhancing public transportation services or adjusting land use. The findings carry implications for policymakers to promote public transport use.},

Hence the topological structure and geometrical layout of the system are not considered. In this paper, factors like the configuration of the public transport system and the surrounding environment of stations are included for the evaluation. The centrality of station index (COS) is presented to describe the importance of stations in the integrated public transport system. The COS index is an improved combination of the gravity model and degree centrality index of the complex network. This index improves the degree centrality index by replacing the number of nodes with weighted connections between stations. By modeling public transport operation, configuration and surroundings of stations, a comprehensive public transport service accessibility index (CPTAI) is formulated to quantify accessibility at the community level. To compute this index, a network analysis model is firstly applied to find the nearest station for each point of interest (POI) by using ArcGIS desktop 10.2, and the transport service frequency at the nearest station is measured. Then Baidu Map API is employed to measure the impedance indexes between stations in the integrated public transport network. Activities covered by stations within a given distance are seen as the generation and attraction of trips in between the stations. Then a weighted gravity model and COS is presented to calculate the integrated service frequency (ISF) for each POI afterward. In the end, the index is converted to the community level, which is CPTAI. The experiment is carried out in Wuhan metropolitan area, Hubei, China. Smart card data (SCD) is utilized to evaluate CPTAI and examine the association between commuting trips by public transport and accessibility level within Wuhan metropolitan area. Experimental results show that CPTAI has a significant statistical association with trips by public transport.},

Network centrality can be calculated using various methodologies. In this study, reach, betweenness, and closeness were used as network centrality indicators. A regression model was used with the characteristics of building use in the station catchment areas as control variables. This methodology was compared to previous studies’ methods for obtaining stations’ topology values. The adjusted R2 values increased by 0.272 and 0.220 for the respective models, explaining the number of passengers and the average travel distance, respectively; the number of significant variables also increased in both models. These results indicate that defining the network centrality obtained through SNA as the station’s topology could improve explanations of the number of passengers and the average travel distance by 27.2\% and 22.0\%, respectively, compared to previous studies. While this methodology is not new, this study demonstrated the advantages of using SNA to determine the centrality indices of urban railway stations.},

	abstract = {There have been growing concerns with regards to the state public transportation systems, particularly in the cities of developing countries. Chief among these concerns has been the lack of well-coordinated, efficient, and reliable transportation systems. The city of Johannesburg, just like any other fast-growing municipality in developing and emerging economies, has not been spared with regards to incessant public transport challenges. Consequently, there have been collective efforts from both public and private stakeholders to invest immensely in both innovative rail and road transport systems in the past decade. This article sought to achieve twin objectives. First, the work identified the state of connectivity between the rapid rail transportation and rapid bus transit systems based on Geoweb 2.0 data. Second, the work visualized the level of connectivity between these two modes to develop and formulate policy frameworks in integrating public transit systems in cities of the developing world, learning from the metropolitan city of Johannesburg. A mixed-method approach consisting of spatial and quantitative aspects was used to examine the state of connectedness and the promotion of access and mobility between the two modes. The local Moran’s I index was used to compute node clusters within the public transport system. Results from the analysis demonstrated that both high-clusters and low-clusters exist in the public transportation network, which have a high degree of centrality. It was revealed that commuters navigate from these nodes/stops with relative ease due to the short walking radius. However, the work revealed that most rail networks and bus routes, as well as the stations and bus stops, are not connected and are not significant in the local Moran’s I index, thus, making it difficult for commuters to conveniently move from the Gautrain to the Rea Vaya bus. There are, therefore, gaps with regards to the sharing of infrastructure between the two public transport modes and systems.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive review of centrality measures and their usefulness in transportation networks in the face of climate change adaptation. The focus is on understanding the importance of transportation nodes in the event of extreme weather events and climate-related disasters that may render them inoperable. The paper argues that if critical nodes can be identified, they can be better protected, while resources can be allocated to ensure their functioning in the event of such events. The paper assesses 17 centrality measures, including degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector, and Katz, and evaluates their usefulness and usability in transportation networks. The review highlights the need to reformulate these measures to take into account traffic- and transport-related parameters and variables. Without this reformulation, centrality measures only reveal node importance in a topological or structural way and fail to capture the true significance of the nodes in a transportation network. The reformulation enables the centrality measures to be properly applied in a transportation network and to expose the significance of their elements. This work has important implications for transportation planners and policy-makers in ensuring the resilience of critical transportation infrastructure in the face of climate-related disasters.},

Quantitative evaluation of pedestrian-oriented urban objectives is important for various cities, and in this paper, a walkability evaluation system for the advanced model is developed considering the characteristics of a large city. The system calculates the walkability of Seoul. The evaluation system uses the Betweenness index as a weight in the urban network analysis. Considering stations with a high betweenness in urban traffic is essential for evaluating a pedestrian-oriented metropolis. Our findings in this study are that the UNA index in WES is critical for transit-oriented, walkable cities. The large city needs to find the location for mobility hubs or stations to observe the last mile. Installing a mobility hub or station at a high-value location in the city center is functionally important. In a pedestrian-oriented city, citizens can walk and bike the last mile in a busy city center. Walkable cities can encourage active transport and ultimately create more sustainable and environmentally friendly transportation systems. This study offers valuable insights into pedestrian infrastructure, urban systems, and policies that promote green transportation.},

	abstract = {Transit-oriented development (TOD) is receiving increasing attention from planners and policymakers as an essential strategy for addressing urban travel inequalities and air pollution. As an analytical method based on the conceptual construct of TOD, the node-place-design (NPD) model is utilized by researchers to assess TOD in urban public transport systems. However, current research prioritizes local perspectives of station development and fails to identify the functions of stations at the system level. In addition, few TOD-related analyses have considered the ecological aspects of cities. In the present study, we used an NPD model to evaluate TOD development at rail stations in Greater Manchester. We incorporated extended indicators of systemic importance and green space coverage in our analysis to provide additional insight into the model. First, we found a low level of TOD integration around stations in Greater Manchester, and some differences in development levels around train stations and Metrolink stations. Second, a comparison with the extended system importance indicators revealed the potential for significant differences in the NPD index and the system importance indicators of stations. This identified some stations that have the potential to take on new routes and some areas that are worthy of transit-oriented development. Finally, we found a specific negative correlation between the NPD index and the green space indicator. This indicated that the TOD model sacrifices green space to a certain extent and demonstrated the importance of including ecological indicators in the TOD assessment. The present study provides additional insight into the NPD model by introducing extended systemic and ecological indicators.},

	abstract = {Under the background of urbanization and the rapid development of urban rail transit (URT), serious attention has been focused on URT network reliability in recent years. In this work, in order to measure network reliability, three indicators are constructed based on passengers’ tolerable travel paths, passenger travel efficiency and passenger travel realization on a URT network. The passenger tolerability coefficient, which is the ratio of passengers’ tolerable travel time to the shortest possible travel time, is proposed and added to the indicators. It reflects passengers’ behavior with respect to choice of travel paths. The ratio of affected passenger volume (RAPV) is proposed to identify important stations. Finally, the connectivity reliability of Wuhan’s subway network is analyzed by simulating attacks on stations. The results show that the degree centrality, betweenness centrality and RAPV indicators of stations can effectively identify the important stations that have a significant impact on the connectivity reliability of the network. In particular, the RAPV indicator effectively identifies stations that have the greatest influence on passenger travel realization. The connectivity reliability of Wuhan’s subway network is sensitive to passenger tolerability coefficient, and reliability is greater during non-peak hours than during peak hours. In addition, the stations that are important to the connectivity reliability of the Wuhan subway have two features, i.e., they are located at the center of the city, and they are important for connecting subgraphs of the network.},

	abstract = {In the study of equity in public transit service distribution to disadvantaged groups, there is often a desire for a concise and relatable quantitative measure of equity. This ambition has often pushed researchers to develop methods for combining (or aggregating) various dimensions of disadvantage into a single, multi-faceted metric of potential transit demand (or need) among the disadvantaged population. These metrics then enable a somewhat straightforward analysis of the transit needs of the aggregate disadvantaged population to the transit service supplied in order to arrive at a measure of transit equity. More recently, it has been proposed that such aggregated transit equity analysis may introduce veiled judgments or bias through the specific interpretation of key definitions and through the particular choices in the construction of a combined metric. It may also be the case that such an aggregate metric may mask or convolute important disparities in transit equity experienced by the various disadvantaged populations aggregated into a combined metric. This research studies these issues through a clear discussion of the ambiguity and implied judgments often found in transit equity literature and then provides recommendations to mitigate these issues. Also, two common equity analysis methods are compared through a case study of public transit service in the city of Corvallis, Oregon, and a new transit service metric construction is introduced. By comparing the results of both the aggregated and disaggregated forms of disadvantaged group transit need within each analysis method, this study provides further evidence that important information may be concealed or easily misinterpreted when using aggregated descriptions of transit need.},

In the United States, the Federal Transit Administration requires transit agencies to assess the equity of proposed service changes using the demographic shares of aﬀected riders. The purpose of the work presented here is to inform the development of more robust transit equity analyses than are currently conducted by integrating measures of accessibility – the ease with destinations can be reached – into FTA-required analyses. The measures are calculated using publicly available data, including the US Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics dataset and transit route and schedule information in the General Transit Feed Speciﬁcation (GTFS) format. The results demonstrate that relying on a single measure (e.g. population shares or accessibility) to associate a route with a particular demographic group is likely to be deﬁcient. Previous academic work on accessibility has not translated well to practice in part because the calculation of accessibility relied upon regional travel demand model outputs that were diﬃcult to obtain. This work thus ﬁlls an important gap in the literature and practice by tying advances in the academic literature to FTA-mandated analysis with publicly available data.},

The comprehensive public transit accessibility (CPTA) score is introduced to evaluate accessibility to transit and to provide a holistic view of transit supply. While previous studies have primarily used proximity or spatial indicators to describe accessibility, this study utilizes a comprehensive set of spatial and temporal measures (connectivity to the network, connectivity to destinations, service frequency, flexibility, and time efficiency) to estimate accessibility to transit. Overlapping areas of high demand (transit dependency) and low supply (as measured using the CPTA) are then characterized as transit deserts. The CPTA score and its application to the analysis of transit deserts provides a universal framework which can be broadly applied by transit agencies, city officials, and transit stakeholders. The con­ tributions of this study are as follows: first, developing a comprehensive framework to estimate transit supply or accessibility; and second, introducing a methodology for identifying transit deserts.},

	abstract = {Transit has long connected people to opportunities but access to transit varies greatly across space. In some cases, unevenly distributed transit supply creates gaps in service that impede travelers’ abilities to cross space and access jobs or other opportunities. With the advent of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, however, travelers now have a new potential to gain automobility without high car purchase costs and in the absence of reliable transit service. Research remains mixed on whether ride-hailing serves as a modal complement or substitute to transit or whether ride-hailing fills transit service needs gaps. This study measures transit supply in Chicago and compares it to ride-hailing origins and destinations to examine if ride-hailing fills existing transit service gaps. Findings reveal clustering of ride-hailing pickups and drop-offs across the City of Chicago, but that the number of ride-hailing pickups and drop-offs was most strongly associated with high neighborhood median household income rather than measures of transit supply. In bivariate analyses, transit service was not associated with ridehailing trip ends. But after controlling for neighborhood socioeconomic status, transit dependency, population density, and employment density, we found fewer ride-hailing trips in neighborhoods where bus service domi­ nated and significantly more ride-hailing trips where rail service was prevalent. Patterns were slightly different for overnight weekend ride-hailing pick-ups, where higher transit density predicted a greater number of trips in nearby tracts. Additional research and policy is needed to ensure that ride-hailing services provide travel options to those who need them the most and fill transit gaps in low-income communities when options to increase service are limited.},

However, the question of whether micromobility services are accessible to and equitably distributed amongst all populations still remains unanswered. In this study, we investigate the spatial accessibility of disadvantaged communities, such as racial and ethnic minorities, low-income populations, and transit-dependent populations, to scooter and bike services. The ultimate goal of this study is to examine associations between the level of access to bikes and scooters and the racial and social characteristics of communities throughout the City of Austin, Texas. To achieve this goal, ﬁrst, equity analysis with a Lorenz curve was performed to understand how bike and scooter accessibility is distributed among the population. Then, both Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models were generated to explore factors associated with bike and scooter accessibility. The analysis of the residuals showed more consistent results in the GWR models than in the OLS models. The equity analysis with the Lorenz curve conducted herein reveals extreme inequity in access to micromobility services. Almost 80 percent of residents have no access to bikes and scooters. Access is even worse for transit-dependent people when compared to the general population. The regression models further revealed that areas with a higher proportion of Black residents were less likely to have access to both bikes and scooters, yet positive associations were found for both bike and scooter accessibility and low-income populations. Increased understanding of spatial access to bikes and scooters can support ongoing efforts to deliver equitable transportation systems, improve transportation alternatives for disadvantaged populations, and support future policy actions related to bike and scooter services.},

	abstract = {Transportation equity is defined as the fair distribution of transportation system outcomes, costs, benefits, and services to individuals or communities. For transportation investments, plans, and projects to advance equitable outcomes, proactive equitable allocation mechanisms are necessary. Proactive equitable allocation mechanisms in transportation refer to the mathematical methods that distribute transportation system outcomes across in­ dividuals, particularly disadvantaged individuals, who are expected to benefit from the potential intervention. While existing conceptual and empirical equity literature establishes the need for proactive equity-driven transportation interventions, literature reviews on equity-focused mathematical approaches to allocate trans­ portation system resources are limited. To this end, this literature review draws from the transportation engi­ neering and operations research literature that focuses on the design of proactive or speculative mathematical methods through simulation and optimization to allocate transportation system outcomes in an equitable way. Through categorizing the literature based on the mathematical method first, followed by the application, we find a variety of conceptual and mathematical definitions of equity applied to an array of modes, applications, and scales of intervention. We also review the research that incorporates individual disadvantage status in deter­ mining the optimal allocation of transportation outcomes and find that many examples define broad categories of disadvantage across population groups, rather than mathematically model the behavior and needs of disad­ vantaged individuals. These findings are critical in laying out future research directions in equitable allocation methods that authentically center the positionalities of disadvantaged individuals, while also balancing other important transportation system objectives and public engagement strategies.},

A transit desert, based on the demand and supply concept in measuring the mismatch in allocating the level of public transit service, has proved its ability to be applied in cases across countries. According to this concept, this study investigated transit deserts in four cases in Europe. Results indicate that the public transit system in Grand Paris and Madrid are superior due to a smaller population living in areas where public transit cannot meet the demand. Moreover, we noticed that the spatial distributions of transit deserts were signiﬁcantly different, and the public transit accessibility of green spaces in Greater London and Madrid requires attention. These ﬁndings prove the potentials of the transit desert concept in generally evaluating and comparing the performance of different regional public transit systems which can guide the public transit investments by regional/cross-national agencies.},

	abstract = {Quantifying transit resources and its networkwide temporal distribution is needed for the informed transit planning and operations decisions. One effective way to estimate the transit resource provision to a zone is to calculate the transit supply index. However, in literature, Supply Index (SI) is modelled considering the transit services allocated to a zone and ignores the quality and quantity of the supply provided between two zones. Addressing this need, this paper proposes a novel origin-destination based supply index (odSI) that incorporates a) zonal characteristics such as transit routes operate in origin zone, number of trips made by those routes, walk buffer areas of transit stops, and the total area of the zone; b) the quality of the service provided in terms of the average speed and route straightness ratio; and c) origin-destination dependent variables such as the minimum number of transfers needed to travel between two zones, the average transit speed between those zones, straightness of transit routes, and total available capacity. As proof of concept, the proposed odSI model is applied on the real network from Brisbane, Australia, at Statistical Area-2 level. The odSI results for 136 × 136 zonal pairs are presented for four different time periods (two peak and two off-peak periods). Furthermore, detailed analysis is carried for a zone, Grange, as an origin and the remaining 135 zones as destinations. The applicability of the proposed odSI model on Brisbane demonstrates its capability to provide valuable insights for an extensive network, which can help planners visualise and improve the complex and cumbersome networks in a more effective manner.},

Results indicated that there is tension around what constitutes meaningful transportation equity work. Key findings centered around a distinction between “performative” equity work and “authentic” equity work. Performative equity work privileges the comfort and perspective of dominant groups, reinforces the status quo, stays in the realm of the rhetoric, and often results in superficial changes only. Authentic equity work centers the experience of Black people and people of color, embraces discomfort, transforms dominant culture, and results in measurable changes to the lives of those historically oppressed. Key recommendations include supporting action-oriented equity work, especially around resource allocation and redistribution of decision-making power to communities.

	abstract = {Research on healthcare accessibility is developing with a focus on multimodal transport modes (MTMs) and multiple time-series variations. A dynamic traffic environment leads travelers to make distinct decisions at different time slots, which impacts spatiotemporal accessibility markedly. Our article proposes a methodological framework to measure spatiotemporal accessibility with multimodal transportation modes and its variation at multiple time series, while accounting for traffic congestion and the probability of residential transport mode choices in a dynamic traffic environment. We selected Nanjing, China, as the study area and pediatric clinic services (PCS) as specific healthcare services to estimate the spatiotemporal accessibility at four representative time slots. The results indicate that the weight estimation of travel time based on MTMs is more propitious than the travel time of single-mode to present real-world travel characteristics and reflects the spatiotemporal distribution and variation of services synthetically. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal accessibility variation of PCS in peripheral suburbs is more pronounced than that in urban centers and rural areas. This work holds pragmatic implications for policymakers in terms of services planning and allocation optimization to improve the equity of resource supply.},

A multi-objective Artificial Bee Colony algorithm is developed to solve the bilevel model. Numerical studies find that: (1) increasing the frequency may not improve the fairness condition; (2) there is a tradeoff between the two objectives (3) the effect of passengers’ risk aversion attitude on the fairness measurement depends on the frequency setting; it could either amplify the fairness measurements or have no impact.},

	abstract = {Urban accessibility by public transport has been attracting increasing attention from researchers and transport agencies in recent years. Many of the studies rely on public transport scheduled timetables from GTFS data to calculate accessibility indicators, overlooking the ways in which inaccuracies in scheduled levels of service, as well as day-to-day travel time variability, might impact different socioeconomic groups. This might generate unrealistic or biased results when analyzing accessibility socio-spatial inequalities and assessing transport pro­ jects. In this study, we consolidate a method to correct timetables of GTFS feeds based on historical GPS data, and use the city of Fortaleza, Brazil, to show how accessibility to work opportunities based on these two accounts can influence the results of accessibility analyses due to two issues: data inaccuracy and day-to-day travel time variabilities. We use 1-month archived GPS data to create new GTFS timetables that represent both a median level of service and a variability-state level of service; then we use these estimated GTFS to examine the impact of travel time inaccuracy and day-to-day variability on accessibility levels. Results show that, due to the problem of data inaccuracy, the scheduled GTFS underestimates accessibility by 1.5\% on average, but in some areas accessibility estimates can be over or underestimated by more than 40\%, with significant impact in low income regions. We also find that the variability of travel times have a significant impact of 50\% on average on accessibility estimates. This impact is unequally distributed both spatially and across income groups, raising accessibility inequality by 30\%. The underlying causes of these impacts are related to several factors, including the GTFS feed's quality, the high concentration of jobs in the city center, and higher travel time variability in the corridors that connect lower-income areas to the city center. These results highlight the importance of consid­ ering both inaccuracy and day-to-day variability issues in public transport travel times when estimating acces­ sibility levels and evaluating transport projects, particularly from an equity perspective.},

While proponents of school choice argue that students can attend any school that will provide them the best education, several have argued that commute time is as important for families as a school’s characteristics. However, research to date models commute time using either distance as a proxy or minutes driving. In Philadelphia, a context where most people use public transportation to work and school, the authors argue that commute time to school must be calculated using this mode of transit. Using geospatial network analyses, the authors create choice sets for each neighborhood public high school. They first calculate the commute time between each zoned public high school and each public high school choice in the city by driving and by using public transportation. These two sets of commute times are then evaluated for the differences. The authors then calculate choice sets based on the average commute time in the city based on both modes of transportation. Finally, they compare the choice sets for each service area for spatial equity of public school quality. Findings indicate that the commute times between driving and public transportation are statistically different. Furthermore, public school choice sets within Philadelphia are spatially equitable, although the overall school quality needs improvement. The article concludes with policy implications and recommendations for future research.},

We show that there are clear inequalities across cohorts in the distribution of beneﬁts that the transit system provides as measured by the number of reachable valued destinations. The results indicate that areas of low accessibility have a higher percentage of African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, low-income workers, low-educated citizens, and the elderly. The most aﬀected cohort are low-income workers, for whom access to jobs, parks, groceries, hospitals, and libraries decline as their number grows.
