= Transit Access
  As seen in /*TODO Reference Section Related Work*/, there are plenty of ways to operationalise transit accessibility, as a local measure.
  For this thesis, I focused on local connectivity without a large focus on specific itinerary scenarios. As detailed in /*TODO reference Methodology*/, data acquisition focused on travel time matrices to ascertain a measure of reach. As as i set up these these travel time matrices, they are an active measure of reach, that is they measure how easy or hard it may be to move from one cell to another, as oppossed how easy it is for a cell to be reached @levinson_towards_2020.
  This can obviously easily be reversed to measure passive reach.
  
  Travel time here is used as a common cost measure for transit accessibility.
  As discussed earlier /*TODO add to related work*/ this is of course not the only realistic measure of impedance.
  As Heidelbergs transit has generally integrated ticketing and a reasonably high degree of people with public transit subscriptions, it seems reasonable to ignore some cost measures like fare rules.
  With this approach to reach, I'm basically approximating the inverse of closeness centrality as formulated by @stamos_transportation_2023.
  
  Transit access, however, depends on temporal aspects as well, both because different destinations offer various time constraints as well as the transport network changing over the course of the day @levinson_towards_2020. As mentioned in /*TODO reference to related work*/, this represents a gap in current travel time datasets, and transit accessibility analyses @verduzco_torres_public_2024. By calculating travel time matrices for every hour of the day for this thesis, I try to fill this gap. 

  == Post-Processing <processing>
    After travel time matrices were calculated with `r5py` @r5py as used in @tenkanen_longitudinal_2020, based on the conveyal engine @Conway_uncertainty_2018, average Travel Times $T_c$ were calculated as in @TravelTimeEq for each cell with $C_d$ as Travel Time Cost from cell to another destination cell divided by the Number of Cells $N_c-1$ for the cell itself.
      $ T_c = (sum C_d)/(N_c-1) $ <TravelTimeEq>
    Here $C_d$ describes the median travel time for a cell to cell connection at every point in time within the set 1 hour time interval given to `r5py`. These average travel times were calculated for 24 hours in a representative day for each cell. Capturing median travel times for each hour of that day from cell to cell, based on the Conveyal approach to travel time uncertainties @Conway_uncertainty_2018. This also represents `r5py`'s default behaviour, as `r5py` @r5py by default returns the median travel time over the supplied departure time window for the travel time matrix calculation. It can also supply other percentile travel times within this departure time window. I will make use of this fact in /*TODO reference next chapter*/.
    
    - Median travel time as with average travel time over the course of the departure time window of an hour can provide a more realistic measure than a single departure point in time @levinson_towards_2020 @owen_modeling_2015
    - also used in @verduzco_torres_public_2024 for metrics spanning the UK, but identified gap in temporal variability of transport choices
  == Detailed Routing
    To illustrate and illucidate some of the results of the above processing, I also provided some handpicked routing examples based on the same gtfs feed @delfi_deutschlandweite_2023.
    These detailed routings take h3 cells @dahn_h3pandas_2023 that i deemed interesting as a departure location and look at times and specific routes to arbitrary central locations within Heidelberg.
    Routing again was provided by r5py @r5py.

    === Travel Times

        - Variations in @map_17_tt
        - Notable similarities
        - Outliers in @map_17_tt

      #figure(image("../figures/Heidelberg_TravelTime_BP17.svg"), caption: [Boxplots showing average travel times per cell grouped by the borough of the start location.]) <boxplot_17_tt>
        - Grouped by borough, notably boroughs can include unpopulated areas.
          - Explains broad spread of boroughs like Altstadt which include a lot of forested area @boxplot_17_tt
      
    === Temporal Variability

      #figure(image("../figures/Heidelberg_TravelTime_MT17.svg"), caption: [Plot of average travel times in Heidelberg from cell to cell with no population mask, over the course of a weekday.]) <daily_travel_time>
       - Night time travel in @daily_travel_time shows a consistent travel time spread. Around 4 am in the morning this fans out however, and while a majority of cells have faster connections a small part actually have longer average median travel times.
       - Outlier one cell on the eastern station throat of RH with no connections to any other cells and therefore an average travel time of 0 minutes, excluded from @daily_travel_time.
